## Installation

### Linux and macOS

1.  Download the latest release binary for your platform:
    ```bash
    # Linux (amd64)
    curl -LO [https://github.com/smadgulkar/spren/releases/latest/download/spren-linux-amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/smadgulkar/spren/releases/latest/download/spren-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
    # macOS (amd64)
    curl -LO [https://github.com/smadgulkar/spren/releases/latest/download/spren-macos-amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/smadgulkar/spren/releases/latest/download/spren-macos-amd64.tar.gz)
    # (Add other architectures like arm64 if available)
    ```
2.  Extract the archive and make the binary executable:
    ```bash
    tar xzf spren-*-amd64.tar.gz
    chmod +x spren
    ```
3.  (Optional) Move the `spren` binary to a directory in your system's PATH for easier access:
    ```bash
    sudo mv spren /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### Windows

1.  Download the `spren-windows-amd64.zip` (or other architecture if available) from the [latest release page](https://github.com/smadgulkar/spren/releases/latest).
2.  Extract the ZIP archive.
3.  You can run `spren.exe` directly from your terminal or move it to a directory included in your system's PATH environment variable.

## Configuration

1.  Run Spren for the first time to generate the default configuration file:
    ```bash
    spren config --show-path # Or simply run 'spren' if it prompts
    ```
2.  Edit the configuration file (`config.toml`) located in the path shown above:
    ```bash
    # Example paths (use the path shown by the command above)
    # Linux/macOS:
    vim ~/.config/spren/config.toml
    # Windows (PowerShell):
    notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.config\spren\config.toml
    ```
    *You'll typically need to add your API keys for the AI providers (like OpenAI or Anthropic) in this file.*

## Usage Examples

Interact with Spren using natural language queries prefixed by `spren` or within its interactive prompt:

Find large files:
```bash
spren show me files larger than 1GB in my home directory
